# Admin Office Shift Rotation System - Complete Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ **Overview**

Your Admin Office now has a **shift rotation system** for managing 2 employees with alternating shifts. When one employee is present, the other is absent, ensuring continuous coverage while managing workload.

## ðŸ“‹ **System Features**

### **Core Functionality:**
- âœ… **Alternating Shifts**: 2 employees work on alternating days
- âœ… **4PM-4PM Schedule**: Both follow standard 4PM-4PM shift with 6PM extended checkout
- âœ… **Automatic Rotation**: System tracks who should work each day
- âœ… **Schedule Preview**: View upcoming 14-day rotation schedule
- âœ… **Flexible Management**: Enable/disable rotation, switch order

### **Business Benefits:**
- âœ… **Workload Distribution**: Prevents employee burnout
- âœ… **Continuous Coverage**: Always one employee available
- âœ… **Fair Scheduling**: Equal work distribution
- âœ… **Easy Management**: Admin can control rotation easily

## ðŸ”§ **How It Works**

### **Rotation Logic:**
```
Day 1: Employee A works (Employee B absent)
Day 2: Employee B works (Employee A absent)
Day 3: Employee A works (Employee B absent)
Day 4: Employee B works (Employee A absent)
... and so on
```

### **Shift Details:**
- **Work Hours**: 4:00 PM - 4:00 PM next day (24-hour shift)
- **Extended Checkout**: Until 6:00 PM next day (26-hour maximum)
- **Storage Logic**: Same 4PM-4PM shift date storage as other sections
- **Attendance Tracking**: Normal QR check-in/check-out process

## ðŸ“± **Using the System**

### **1. Setup Rotation (Admin)**

#### **Access the Screen:**
1. Open main menu (hamburger icon)
2. Select "Admin Office Rotation"
3. You'll see the rotation management screen

#### **Configure New Rotation:**
1. **Select Employees**: Choose 2 Admin Office employees from dropdowns
2. **Set Start Date**: Pick when rotation begins
3. **Choose Order**: Select which employee starts first
4. **Save**: Click "Setup Rotation" to activate

#### **Example Setup:**
```
Employee 1: John Smith
Employee 2: Jane Doe
Start Date: January 15, 2024
John starts first: âœ“ (checked)

Result:
- Jan 15: John works
- Jan 16: Jane works
- Jan 17: John works
- Jan 18: Jane works
```

### **2. Managing Active Rotation**

#### **Current Status Card:**
- Shows active/inactive status
- Displays employee names and start date
- Shows current rotation order

#### **Control Options:**
- **Enable/Disable**: Turn rotation on/off
- **Switch Order**: Change which employee goes first
- **View Schedule**: See next 14 days preview

### **3. Daily Operations**

#### **For Employees:**
- **Check Schedule**: Admin can tell them their assigned days
- **Normal Attendance**: Use regular QR check-in/check-out
- **Same Rules**: 4PM-4PM shift with 6PM extended checkout

#### **For Admin:**
- **Monitor Attendance**: Check if scheduled employee is present
- **Adjust if Needed**: Can disable rotation for emergencies
- **View Reports**: Attendance history shows actual vs scheduled

## ðŸ“Š **Integration with Existing Systems**

### **Attendance Tracking:**
- âœ… **Same QR Process**: No changes to check-in/check-out
- âœ… **Same Storage**: Uses existing 4PM-4PM shift logic
- âœ… **Same Extended Checkout**: 6PM rule still applies
- âœ… **Same History**: Appears in attendance history normally

### **KPI Calculations:**
- âœ… **Individual KPIs**: Each employee gets separate metrics
- âœ… **Section KPIs**: Admin Office section shows combined data
- âœ… **Punctuality**: Based on 4PM check-in time
- âœ… **Attendance Rate**: Calculated per employee's scheduled days

### **Payroll Integration:**
- âœ… **Individual Payroll**: Each employee paid for their worked days
- âœ… **Absent Day Handling**: Only deducted for scheduled days missed
- âœ… **Same Calculation**: Uses existing 30-day payroll logic
- âœ… **Paid Leave**: Can still mark paid leave for scheduled days

## ðŸŽ¯ **Example Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Normal Rotation**
```
Setup:
- Employee A: John (starts first)
- Employee B: Jane
- Start: January 15, 2024

Schedule:
Jan 15 (Mon): John works 4PM-4PM (can extend to 6PM Jan 16)
Jan 16 (Tue): Jane works 4PM-4PM (can extend to 6PM Jan 17)
Jan 17 (Wed): John works 4PM-4PM (can extend to 6PM Jan 18)
Jan 18 (Thu): Jane works 4PM-4PM (can extend to 6PM Jan 19)
```

### **Scenario 2: Employee Absence**
```
Scheduled: John should work January 15
Reality: John doesn't show up

System Response:
- Attendance: Marked as absent for John
- KPI: Affects John's attendance rate
- Payroll: John loses pay for January 15
- Coverage: Admin can manually assign Jane or disable rotation
```

### **Scenario 3: Emergency Coverage**
```
Situation: Jane is sick for 3 days
Admin Action:
1. Disable rotation temporarily
2. John works all days during Jane's absence
3. Re-enable rotation when Jane returns
4. Mark Jane's sick days as paid leave if needed
```

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Structure:**
```
shift_rotations/
â””â”€â”€ Admin office/
    â”œâ”€â”€ employee1Id: "john_123"
    â”œâ”€â”€ employee1Name: "John Smith"
    â”œâ”€â”€ employee2Id: "jane_456"
    â”œâ”€â”€ employee2Name: "Jane Doe"
    â”œâ”€â”€ startDate: "2024-01-15"
    â”œâ”€â”€ employee1StartsFirst: true
    â”œâ”€â”€ isActive: true
    â”œâ”€â”€ createdAt: Timestamp
    â””â”€â”€ lastUpdated: Timestamp
```

### **Rotation Calculation:**
```dart
// Calculate which employee should work
final daysSinceStart = date.difference(startDate).inDays;
final isEvenDay = daysSinceStart % 2 == 0;

if (employee1StartsFirst) {
  return isEvenDay ? employee1Id : employee2Id;
} else {
  return isEvenDay ? employee2Id : employee1Id;
}
```

### **API Methods:**
```dart
// Setup rotation
ShiftRotationService.setupShiftRotation(...)

// Get scheduled employee
ShiftRotationService.getScheduledEmployee(date)

// Check if employee is scheduled
ShiftRotationService.isEmployeeScheduled(employeeId, date)

// Get rotation schedule
ShiftRotationService.getRotationSchedule(startDate, endDate)
